Rails API Doc Generator
=======================

RESTTful API documentation generator for Rails. It supports Rails 2.1 and greater. It generates a set of HTML views in the public directory. Parses the desired controllers and generates appropriate views.

Currently does not read routes.rb and requires manual entry of routes

Installation
============

`gem install rapi_doc`

Usage
=====

Run `rake rapi_doc:setup` to generate config and layout files.

Modify config file by adding your controllers, e.g.:

    books:
      location: "/books"
      controller_name: "books_controller.rb"

Then invoke the generation by calling:

`rake rapi_doc:generate`
